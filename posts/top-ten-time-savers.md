These are the top 10 tips & tricks that I save me the most time and that I'd have the hardest time doing without:

1. SN Utils

2. Windows key + V for pasting clipboard

3. Using &sysparm_force_row_count=1&sysparm_group_sort=COUNTDESC

4. Adding dot-walked fields in list layouts

5. Directly modifying the list view query

6. Comprehensive search tool

7. SN Utils script sync + GitHub Copilot

8. Set fields to visible, editable, and non-mandatory

9. Service portal debugging

10. Tab reloading extensions to prevent session timeout
